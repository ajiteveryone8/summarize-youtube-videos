Summary:
 In today's video, we're going to build a homemade air conditioner with very few components . To begin, we'll need a 4x6 mm copper tube . This tube, thanks to its thermal conductivity, will serve as an evaporator . Now, we are going to attach the components to a small wooden structure .
 A few cable ties will be enough to secure our duct . We insert the cable ties into the duct support brackets... and we're going to secure the evaporator . Now that we have the circuit connected, we'll add a small and inexpensive 12-volt fan .
 The heart of the system is the refrigeration cycle, based on a simple physical principle: using a gas that absorbs heat from the environment when it evaporates . That gas is isobutane, Â using a small 9-volt battery to power our portable air conditioner .
 When isobutane changes from liquid to gas, it needs energy from the heat of the surrounding air . This transfer is what cools the system . Once evaporated, the gas needs to be converted back into liquid to repeat the process .
 We now have our air conditioning unit finished and ready to start cooling the room . The fan will provide a blast of cold air that will cool any room in just a few minutes . Ressure gas and compresses it, increasing its temperature .
